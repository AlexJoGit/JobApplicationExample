# JobApplicationExample
an example project to show my prior experience with programming 

MapEditor is a practice in OpenGL and scanning/evaluating files, made in VisualStudio2019, some of it is automatically generated,
so the most interesting files are:   /MapEditor/MapEditor/Reader.cs and /MapEditor/MapEditor/Window.cs
